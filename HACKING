QUESTIONS

 - where to store .js code that you want to use both server-side and
   client-side ? For example, date.js and its setRFC3339 function.
   e.g. http://localhost:5984/mushin/_design/mushin/jquery.mushin.js
   is stored at couchdb/_attachments/jquery.mushin.js
   e.g. http://localhost:5984/mushin/_design/mushin/vendor/couchapp/jquery.couchapp.js
   is stored at couchdb/vendor/couchapp/_attachments/jquery.couchapp.js
   For now, we created a symlink
