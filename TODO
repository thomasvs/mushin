TODO:
-----
 - convert all commands to using getNewServer()
 - parse search lines and apply filters in most useful order
 - Figure out what to do with docs without start date - maybe we have a bug
   introducing these ?
 - add something to create the database first time
 - handle 404 on replication when target doesn't have that db name

 - any exception from any gobject callback needs to be handled somehow with
   a dialog, to inform the user
 - why does by-projects view also emit date in key ?

- new dialog:
  - no way to unset project/flag/... done does not click

- maemo version:
  - when completing a task, you go back to a list view where that task is still in there because it was not updated
  - when completing a recurring task, the thing gets a new revision that should be gotten from couchdb, so that the next update on the same thing does not conflict.

- couchdb part:
  - by-*: agree on whether they list open or closed things

- decide on flags versus statuses
