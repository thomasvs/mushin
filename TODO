gtd (command line client):

- now that mushin-hoodie added state (1 for active, 2 for archive),
  add that to our data model, with the enum.  Make sure all views handle
  an unset state as well.
- make it possible to work in 'hoodie mode' on a replica of a hoodie db
  (for example my mushin-hoodie local copy)

- add authentication support to replication
  - allow specifying username/password for remote host, parse it properly,
    without displaying it
  - allow asking for password of localhost
- don't use httplib for adding replication; add it to paisley.
- integrate paisley's use of logging with our logging
- convert all commands to using getNewServer()
- parse search lines and apply filters in most useful order
- Figure out what to do with docs without start date - maybe we have a bug
  introducing these ?
- add something to create the database first time
- fix delete 0sst
- fix delete:

- bug when typing 'list' in cmd line interpreter - the error message is output
  on the same line as the command, instead of first getting a newline on stderr

maemo-mushin (maemo GUI):

- any exception from any gobject callback needs to be handled somehow with
  a dialog, to inform the user
- why does by-projects view also emit date in key ?
- new dialog:
  - no way to unset project/flag/... done does not click
- when completing a task, you go back to a list view where that task is still
  in there because it was not updated
- when completing a recurring task, the thing gets a new revision that should
  be gotten from couchdb, so that the next update on the same thing does not
  conflict.
- instead of getting the view of all projects on opening a task, keep it around
  and parse change notifications

couchdb:
- by-*: agree on whether they list open or closed things
- decide on flags versus statuses
